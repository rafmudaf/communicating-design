# Intro to architecture

Software are complex systems with varying levels of abstraction.
While reasonably complex and functional software can be produced without consideration
for the high level structure, scalability is often limited without a plan for
increasing the scope and pace of development.
Software architecture is the result of intentionally designing the high level structure of
a software.
