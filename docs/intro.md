# Communicating elements of software architecture and design

This notebook is a collection of notes and ideas on communicating elements of
software architecture and design.
It is a work in progress and will be updated throughout 2023.

Software architecture is the result of deliberately designing the relationship between
components of a software system.
While a general structure of the relationships can be inferred through reading the
code itself, the architecture of complex software is often difficult to comprehend accurately
and in a reasonable amount of time in this manner.
To enable further development of a software, it is critical to document and communicate
the design intent and architectural elements for both current developers in the future
and new developers joining the project.
In practice, the architecture of a software is often communicated through a combination
of diagrams that each address a different aspect of the holistic design.

This notebook details specific types of diagrams used in the context of communicating software
architecture and design.
Additionally, tools to produce the diagrams are presented along with additional training resources.
Finally, methods for effectively communicating these ideas as part of the project workflow are
proposed.

This is intended to be a community resource, so please engage!
Create a [Discussion](https://github.com/rafmudaf/communicating-design/discussions) in the
repository to talk about a particular concept, or open an
[Issue](https://github.com/rafmudaf/communicating-design/issues) to let me know where I've
missed something. [Pull requests](https://github.com/rafmudaf/communicating-design/pulls)
are welcome, and I will engage with them as quickly as possible.
Lastly, feel free to contact me directly at rafael.mudafort@nrel.gov.
