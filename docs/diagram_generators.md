# Generators

# Software generators

There are lots of software tools to create diagrams of any type and use case.
Two popular options with GUI's are:
- yEd
- draw.io

Other commonly used software libraries embedded within other generators are:
- Graphviz with dot
- PlantUML
- Mermaid

An important aspect of diagrams created by software is their file type and data structure.
Some file types are compatible or convertible, while others require adhering to a specific
tech stack.

## Filetypes
Briefly describe the file types, which are convertible, and make a broad recommendation
on which to adopt and which to avoid.

# Mermaid text-based generator

Possibly broaden to include other text-based diagram generators.

Describe mermaid and what it enables in the context of software documentation:
- Rendered in GitHub elements such as comments on any thread (Issues, PR, etc)
- Rendered in GitHub Pages
- Rendered in Jupyter Notebooks
- Very easy to extend and build large diagrams quickly
- Can be used in any text editor
- Customizable styling (limited, but functional)

Cons:
- No control over placement of elements
- Limited functionality for less common diagram types
