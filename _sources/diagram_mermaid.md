# Mermaid text-based generator

Possibly broaden to include other text-based diagram generators.

Describe mermaid and what it enables in the context of software documentation:
- Rendered in GitHub elements such as comments on any thread (Issues, PR, etc)
- Rendered in GitHub Pages
- Rendered in Jupyter Notebooks
- Very easy to extend and build large diagrams quickly
- Can be used in any text editor
- Customizable styling (limited, but functional)

Cons:
- No control over placement of elements
- Limited functionality for less common diagram types
