# Software generators

There are lots of software tools to create diagrams of any type and use case.
Two popular options with GUI's are:
- yEd
- draw.io

Other commonly used software libraries embedded within other generators are:
- Graphviz with dot
- PlantUML
- Mermaid

Some file types are compatible or convertible, while others require adhering to a specific
tech stack.
